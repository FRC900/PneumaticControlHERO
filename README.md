HERO Code for the Pneumatic Control Module and a Logitech F310

The nonFRC firmware for the PCM needs to be loaded.

Compressor should cut on and use the pressure switch as normal if a controller is plugged in.

The buttons are all Press and Hold, none are setup as toggles.

Buttons are Mapped as Follows on the F310:

 -Button 1 (X): Solenoid 0
 -Button 2 (A): Solenoid 1
 -Button 3 (B): Solenoid 2
 -Button 4 (Y): Solenoid 3
 -Button 5 (LB): Solenoid 4
 -Button 6 (RB): Solenoid 5
 -Button 7 (LT): Solenoid 6
 -Button 8 (RT): Solenoid 7

Portions of this code were shamelessly stolen from Cross The Road Electronics examples.  Thanks CTRE folks, you're the real HEROs. ;)
